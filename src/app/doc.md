## API

Any item can be `disabled` for prevent selection. For disable an item add the property `disabled` to the item.

| Input  | Type | Default |  Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |  ------------- |
| [items] | any[] | `[]` |   Items array. Should be an array of objects with `id` and `text` properties. As convenience, you may also pass an array of strings, in which case the same string is used for both the ID and the text. Items may be nested by adding a `options` property to any item, whose value should be another array of items. Items that have children may omit to have an ID. |
| optionValueField | string | `'id'` |  Provide an opportunity to change the name an `id` property of objects in the `items`  |
| optionTextField | string | `'text'` |  Provide an opportunity to change the name a `text` property of objects in the `items` |
| optGroupLabelField | string | `'label'` |  Provide an opportunity to change the name a `label` property of objects with an `options` property in the `items` |
| optGroupOptionsField | string | `'options'` |  Provide an opportunity to change the name of an `options` property of objects in the `items` |
| [multiple] | boolean | `false` |  Mode of this component. If set `true` user can select more than one option |
| [allowClear] | boolean | `false` |  Set to `true` to allow the selection to be cleared. This option only applies to single-value inputs |
| [placeholder] | string | `''` |  Set to `true` Placeholder text to display when the element has no focus and selected items |
| [noAutoComplete] | boolean | `false` |  Set to `true` Set to `true` to hide the search input. This option only applies to single-value inputs |
| [disabled] | boolean | `false` |  When `true`, it specifies that the component should be disabled |
| [defaultValue] | any[] | `[]` |  Use to set default value |
| autoSelectSingleOption | boolean | `false` | Auto select a non disabled single option |

| Output  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| (typed)  | Fired on changing search input. Returns `string` with that value. |
| (focus)  | Fired on select focus |
| (blur)  | Fired on select blur |
| (open)  | Fired on select dropdown open |
| (close)  | Fired on select dropdown close |
| (select)  | Fired on an item selected by user. Returns value of the selected item. |
| (remove)  | Fired on an item removed by user. Returns value of the removed item. |

**Warning!** Although the component contains the `select` and the `remove` events, the better solution is using `valueChanches` of the `FormControl`.

```typescript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {FormControl} from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-example',
    template: `<ngx-select [items]="['111', '222']" [formControl]="selectControl"></ngx-select>`
})
class ExampleComponent {
    public selectControl = new FormControl();
    
    constructor() {
        this.selectControl.valueChanges.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
    }
}
```
